 * total in software. The buffers and the backlog can be freely assigned to the
 * write and read queues.
 * 
 * {@link can_v2_write_frame} writes a frame into the write backlog. The Bricklet moves
 * the frame from the backlog into a free write buffer. The CAN transceiver then
 * transmits the frame from the write buffer to the CAN bus. If there are no
 * write buffers (``write_buffer_size`` is zero) or there is no write backlog
 * (``write_backlog_size`` is zero) then no frames can be transmitted and
 * {@link can_v2_write_frame} returns always *false*.
 * 
 * The CAN transceiver receives a frame from the CAN bus and stores it into a
 * free read buffer. The Bricklet moves the frame from the read buffer into the
 * read backlog. {@link can_v2_read_frame} reads the frame from the read backlog and
 * returns it. If there are no read buffers (``read_buffer_sizes`` is empty) or
 * there is no read backlog (``read_backlog_size`` is zero) then no frames can be
 * received and {@link can_v2_read_frame} returns always *false*.
 * 
 * There can be multiple read buffers, because the CAN transceiver cannot receive
 * data and remote frames into the same read buffer. A positive read buffer size
 * represents a data frame read buffer and a negative read buffer size represents
 * a remote frame read buffer. A read buffer size of zero is not allowed. By
 * default the first read buffer is configured for data frames and the second read
 * buffer is configured for remote frame. There can be up to 32 different read
 * buffers, assuming that no write buffer is used. Each read buffer has its own
 * filter configuration (see {@link can_v2_set_read_filter_configuration}).
 * 
 * A valid queue configuration fulfills these conditions::
 * 
 *  write_buffer_size + abs(read_buffer_size_0) + abs(read_buffer_size_1) + ... + abs(read_buffer_size_31) <= 32
 *  write_backlog_size + read_backlog_size <= 768
 * 
 * The write buffer timeout has three different modes that define how a failed
 * frame transmission should be handled:
 * 
 * * Single-Shot (< 0): Only one transmission attempt will be made. If the
 *   transmission fails then the frame is discarded.
 * * Infinite (= 0): Infinite transmission attempts will be made. The frame will
 *   never be discarded.
 * * Milliseconds (> 0): A limited number of transmission attempts will be made.
 *   If the frame could not be transmitted successfully after the configured
 *   number of milliseconds then the frame is discarded.
 * 
 * The current content of the queues is lost when this function is called.

 * * Match-Standard-Only: Only standard frames with a matching identifier are
 *   received.
 * * Match-Extended-Only: Only extended frames with a matching identifier are
 *   received.
 * * Match-Standard-And-Extended: Standard and extended frames with a matching
 *   identifier are received.
 * 
 * The filter mask and filter identifier are used as bit masks. Their usage
 * depends on the mode:
 * 
 * * Accept-All: Mask and identifier are ignored.
 * * Match-Standard-Only: Bit 0 to 10 (11 bits) of filter mask and filter
 *   identifier are used to match the 11-bit identifier of standard frames.
 * * Match-Extended-Only: Bit 0 to 28 (29 bits) of filter mask and filter
 *   identifier are used to match the 29-bit identifier of extended frames.
 * * Match-Standard-And-Extended: Bit 18 to 28 (11 bits) of filter mask and filter
 *   identifier are used to match the 11-bit identifier of standard frames, bit 0
 *   to 17 (18 bits) are ignored in this case. Bit 0 to 28 (29 bits) of filter
 *   mask and filter identifier are used to match the 29-bit identifier of extended
 *   frames.
 * 
 * The filter mask and filter identifier are applied in this way: The filter mask
 * is used to select the frame identifier bits that should be compared to the
 * corresponding filter identifier bits. All unselected bits are automatically
 * accepted. All selected bits have to match the filter identifier to be accepted.
 * If all bits for the selected mode are accepted then the frame is accepted and
 * is added to the read buffer.
 * 
 * \verbatim
 *  "Filter Mask Bit", "Filter Identifier Bit", "Frame Identifier Bit", "Result"

 *  1, 0, 0, Accept
 *  1, 0, 1, Reject
 *  1, 1, 0, Reject
 *  1, 1, 1, Accept
 * \endverbatim
 * 
 * For example, to receive standard frames with identifier 0x123 only, the mode
 * can be set to Match-Standard-Only with 0x7FF as mask and 0x123 as identifier.
 * The mask of 0x7FF selects all 11 identifier bits for matching so that the
 * identifier has to be exactly 0x123 to be accepted.
 * 
 * To accept identifier 0x123 and identifier 0x456 at the same time, just set
 * filter 2 to 0x456 and keep mask and filter 1 unchanged.
 * 
 * There can be up to 32 different read filters configured at the same time,
 * because there can be up to 32 read buffer (see {@link can_v2_set_queue_configuration}).
 * 
 * The default mode is accept-all for all read buffers.

 * 
 * There can be multiple read buffers, because the CAN transceiver cannot receive
