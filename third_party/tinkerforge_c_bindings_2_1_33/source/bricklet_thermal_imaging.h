 * * Index 2: Column end (has to be smaller then 80).
 * * Index 3: Row end (has to be smaller then 60).
 * 
 * The algorithm to generate the high contrast image is applied to this region.
 * 
 * Dampening Factor: This parameter is the amount of temporal dampening applied to the HEQ
 * (history equalization) transformation function. An IIR filter of the form::
 * 
 *  (N / 256) * previous + ((256 - N) / 256) * current
 * 
 * is applied, and the HEQ dampening factor
 * represents the value N in the equation, i.e., a value that applies to the amount of
 * influence the previous HEQ transformation function has on the current function. The
 * lower the value of N the higher the influence of the current video frame whereas
 * the higher the value of N the more influence the previous damped transfer function has.
 * 
 * Clip Limit Index 0 (AGC HEQ Clip Limit High): This parameter defines the maximum number of pixels allowed
 * to accumulate in any given histogram bin. Any additional pixels in a given bin are clipped.
 * The effect of this parameter is to limit the influence of highly-populated bins on the
 * resulting HEQ transformation function.
 * 
 * Clip Limit Index 1 (AGC HEQ Clip Limit Low): This parameter defines an artificial population that is added to
 * every non-empty histogram bin. In other words, if the Clip Limit Low is set to L, a bin
 * with an actual population of X will have an effective population of L + X. Any empty bin
 * that is nearby a populated bin will be given an artificial population of L. The effect of
 * higher values is to provide a more linear transfer function; lower values provide a more
 * non-linear (equalized) transfer function.
 * 
 * Empty Counts: This parameter specifies the maximum number of pixels in a bin that will be
 * interpreted as an empty bin. Histogram bins with this number of pixels or less will be
 * processed as an empty bin.
