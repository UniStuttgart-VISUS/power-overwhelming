Description
--------------------------
The NVIDIA Management Library (NVML) is a C-based API for
monitoring and managing various states of the NVIDIA GPU devices.
It provides a direct access to the queries and commands exposed
via nvidia-smi. The runtime version of NVML ships with the NVIDIA
display driver, and the SDK provides the appropriate header, stub
libraries and sample applications. Each new version of NVML is
backwards compatible and is intended to be a platform for building
3rd party applications.

For more information see the docs in the doc/ directory.
