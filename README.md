# Power Overwhelming
This project provides a library for measuring the power consumption of GPUs (and other system components) by various means.


# Support for Rohde & Schwarz instruments
The library supports reading Rohde & Schwarz RTB 2000 oscilloscopes and HMC8015 power analysers. In order for this to work, VISA must be installed on the development machine. You can download the drivers from 
https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/de/driver-pages/fernsteuerung/3-visa-and-tools_231388.html. The VISA installation is automatically detected from the respective property sheet.
